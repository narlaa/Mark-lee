        <h1> PROFILE</h1>
        <img src="The Darkest Side of His Love.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Mark Lee started his musical journey when his parents enrolled him in a music school after moving to South
            Korea from Canada. While adjusting to a new life and culture, he started to play the guitar in his free
            time. In 2012, he decided to enter a competition called ‘S.M. Global Audition’ that was being held in Canada
            at that time. He was selected in the global audition and entered a training group of S.M. Entertainment.
            ‘S.M. Entertainment’ is South Korea's largest entertainment company that has been instrumental in finding
            and developing K-pop’s biggest stars.
            By December 2013, he had become part of a group of trainees ‘S.M. Rookies’ and underwent rigourous training
            as part of the group. Along with the other group members, he featured in ‘Disney Channel Korea’s’ ‘Mickey
            Mouse Club’ in 2015. <br><br><br>
            2016 was a big year for him. On April 4, 2016, S.M. Entertainment announced that Mark Lee would make his
            debut as a member of the boy-group ‘NCT U’. ‘NCT’ stands for ‘Neo Culture Technology’, a term created by
            S.M. Entertainment’s founder that describes the concept of a group having an unlimited number of members
            further divided into various sub-units based on certain criteria. <br><br><br>
            NCT’s first sub-unit, NCT U, released their first digital single, ‘The 7th Sense’, on April 9, 2016 and
            ‘Without You’ on April 10, 2016. The ‘U’ in ‘NCT U’ stands for ‘United’; it is a rotational group whose
            members can change on the basis of the requirements of the song. ‘The 7th Sense’ song had a hip-hop groove
            which perfectly suited Mark’s specialty rapping skills.
            In July 2016, Mark Lee was selected as a member of the second sub-unit, NCT 127, and the group released
            their debut song ‘Firetruck’. ‘127’ in the group’s name stands for the longitude coordinates of Seoul.
            Throughout 2016, he continued to release new songs, perform live on stage and in music videos for ‘NCT 127’.
            Mark Lee is a Korean-Canadian artist under SM Entertainment. He is best known for being the Main Rapper
            and Vocalist of the boy group NCT and its sub-units NCT U, NCT 127, and NCT Dream. <br><br><br>
            Mark was born in Vancouver Canada on August 2, 1999. He was able to audition for SM Entertainment
            through SM Global Audition in Vancouver. He was accepted and ultimately became a trainee for four years
            before finally debuting as a member of NCT.

            On December 31, 2018, Mark officially graduated from NCT Dream.

            In April of 2021, SM Entertainment reported that Mark will be officially returning to the sub-unit NCT
            Dream, making NCT Dream a fixed sub-unit with all seven original members, with their 1st comeback after
            coming back together being their single "Hot Sauce".

            Mark released his first solo single "Child" on February 4, as part of NCT Lab, a special season of the
            SM Station project.</p>
